The table presents the results of a survey conducted on two groups of students, one from a university and one from a school, about their experiences in practical Physics work. The table is divided into seven sections, each representing a different question (Q1 (a) to Q1 (g)). For each question, the table shows the percentage of students who answered positively, neutrally, or negatively. The table also shows the results of a chi-squared test, which was used to compare the responses of the two groups of students. The chi-squared test results include the chi-squared value, the degrees of freedom, and the p-value. The p-value indicates the probability of obtaining the observed results if there is no difference between the two groups of students. A p-value less than 0.05 is generally considered to be statistically significant, which means that there is a significant difference between the two groups of students.
