The table shows the results of a survey of students' experiences in practical Physics work. The survey was given to two groups of students: a University group and a School group. The table shows the percentage of students in each group who answered positively, neutrally, or negatively to each question. The table also shows the results of a chi-squared test of independence, which was used to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between the responses of the two groups.
