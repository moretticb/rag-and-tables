The table presents the results of a survey conducted on two groups of students, University group and School group, about their experiences in practical Physics work. The table is divided into seven sections, each representing a different question (Q1 (a) to Q1 (g)). For each question, the table shows the percentage of students who answered "positive", "neutral", or "negative". The table also shows the results of a chi-squared test of independence, which was used to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between the responses of the two groups. The chi-squared value, degrees of freedom, and p-value are reported for each question.
